masterpush.sh
---

Simple shell script that's helpful for a cloned github repo. 
This git adds all the files in the repo, commits with a message, and pushes the  repo content to the master branch of the origin repo.

The script runs with one argument, and this argument is the message for the commit.

Example use: ./masterpush.sh "fixed bugs in code"
